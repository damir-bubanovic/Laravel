!! ULTRA - DEPLOYMENT - UPLOAD ON SERVER !!

- all the information is here
	http://devmarketer.io/learn/deploy-laravel-5-app-lemp-stack-ubuntu-nginx/
	
> OUR GOAL - put a laravel app on a shared host (extreemely difficult)

> USE - Digital Ocean, Linode, Vultr - (We are going to use this)
	-> however that costs 5$ a month for basic package (virtual private servers)
	-> 10x more powerfull than shared host
	+- you have to set up entire server - git, apache, php...
	
> USE - PLATFORM AS A SERVICE - Fortrabbit, Heroku, Pagoda Box, Engine Yard
	+ entire server is already set up (similar like share host, but with private server)

- not going to explain much here because I need a server
